           NewSpice is a brand designed especially for cleaning homo-sapiens, thats right, that means you too buck-a-roo. If you think you smell bad, youre hair feels like its rotting,
           maybe even, your toes are starting to get really grimmy and you dont have a girlfriend to do the job for you. Well thats where you turn to this brand, to us. In the minds
           of the big family that works at NewSpice, we consider your toes first! In fact we think of our customers as our human pets to try out each individual product and therefore
           take you in as our own and treat you like we would our own dogs, our own dogs who smell like our finnest deoderant products. You can find our main store in chelsea in the UK right 
           in front of Gordon Ramsays restaurant just because we wanted the smell of our products to influence his dishes. Our finnal goal is to please all of our employees with your 
           money just like we were when we started in May 28, 2016. At least one good thing happened that day.

            To start off, an introduction to our very own <a class="hidentext" class="bye" href="./spray.html">spray</a>. This is a classic product of ours that is in enduring constant change in rotation with 
            the new ideas our custumers have, which brings me to not only <span class="right">item #2</span>  the <a href="./creamytoes.html"></a> not only that its our second product in command. This product,
            which is also in constant change all around the clock is actually <span class="right">edible</span>, all natural and a moisturizer all in just one product. Next up is the 
            <a class="hidentext" class="bye" href="./anti.html">Antipersperant</a>, an amazing product that'll blow your mind and your expectations into oblivion. Our Antipersperant will make your pores unable to sweat 
            for an unprecdented amount of time, thats right 1 whole hour. Following up is our <span class="right">"super duper"</span> jelly like shampoo made from the endangered 
            spieces, the zebra and their wunderfully beautiful manes. Once applied the transformation happens and your head recieves <span class="right">3 times</span> as much oxygen and up to <span class="right">5 times</span> as much sarin!!. 
            Finaly or regular <a class="hidentext" class="bye" href="./stick.html">Deoderant-Sticks</a> this product acts as a cover, for the awful stench your body gives off after working out. The amazing thing 
            about this product is that it is not designed to smell good regularly but only once you've sarted persperating and smelling like your dog.
