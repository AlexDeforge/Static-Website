 <p><br><br><br> A message from our competitor Tide:</p>
 
 
 
          <p> Wow! The New-Spice's chefs have out done themselves 
              this year, they have made the toe cream and the other 
              products have incredible umami and the raw fact that 
              someone can make cleaning products that taste like 
              pure elegance must recieve an incredible michelin 
              review. To the cleaning product with such finesse, 
              congradulations on your second michelin star.
        </p>


          <p> As the head of Tide's marketing and advertisment 
              department Tide truly believes that New-Spice is a
              worthy adversary and competitor in the cleaning and
              food department. Though they specialize in cleansing 
              the body, we still compete in with our alimentary 
              products. For example we have our deadly tasty Tide
              Pods that we hold dear in our hearts they have 
              they're award winning products that taste out of 
              this world.
